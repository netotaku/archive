Richard D James was a regular DJ in the Cornish towns near where he lived with his friend Tom Middleton (who would go on to be better known as one half of Global Communication and Jedi Knights who would release the seminal respective albums 76.14 (ambient) and New School Science (electro funk)). They would also collaborate on the first Aphex Twin release ‘Analogue Bubblebath EP in 1991 which we’ll be visiting tomorrow.

In 1991 (aged 19) he started the Replex record label with his friend Grant Wilson-Claridge on which released Bradley’s Beat under the pseudonym Bradley Strider. He released Analogue Bubblebath EP vol 2 on a local label in the same year under the name ‘AFX’ and in January 1992 he released the ‘Pac Man’ single as Power-Pill, a rave version of the music from the video game through FFRR at the height of ‘toytown techno’.

In February he released Selected Ambient Works 85-92 through the Belgian dance label R&S. It is widely accepted as one of the best and most important ambient albums of all time. Some of the album features music made when he was 14. ‘I’ is one of these older songs. It’s mainly analogue instrumental but you’ll notice a few samples - Willy Wonka turns up, so does Robocop and some of Morricone’s score from The Thing.

It’s incredibly accessible and a nice way to start the immersion.
